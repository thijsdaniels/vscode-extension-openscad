- Title: Make sure to use short, Title Case text. It should just have enough information to identify the issue, but not so much that the issues list becomes hard to parse. Avoid using prefixes or issue types in the title, we should use labels for that instead.
- Description: This can be more free-form. Depending on what is relevant, here are some things to consider including:
  - a problem statement
  - the desired outcome
  - the value to the end user
  - the desired user experience
  - a concise suggestion for implementation
  - architectural considerations
- Assignee: Assign the issue to the repository owner.
- Labels: Determine if any of the existing labels are applicable to the issue, and apply them if so.

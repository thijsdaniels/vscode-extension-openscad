description: When planning out a new feature or a refactor.

Generally in engineering, the simpler solution is the better solution. Less complexity means fewer opportunities for mistakes and is easier to understand and to build upon. Keep this in mind when planning out how to implement a change. There is a limit to the benefits of simplicity, though; we should also anticipate future changes and sometimes decide to prepare for future complexity, so that instead of refactoring, we can simply expand, which requires careful abstraction. With this in mind, after you form a plan, iterate on it until you're confident that we have found the simplest, most robust solution that is still logical, readable and sustainable.
